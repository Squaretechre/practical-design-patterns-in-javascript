# Flyweight Pattern

## Conserves memory by sharing portions of an object between objects

- Shares data across objects.
- Results in smaller memory footprint.
- Only use if you have a `large` number of objects.
- Useful for large data sets / many instances of an object.
- Overhead to implementing the pattern.
